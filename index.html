            <h3>Stochastic Market Modeling</h3>
            <p>I've been interested in the markets for longer than I&rsquo;ve been interested in programming; in fact it was the desire to better model equities that forced me to write my first line of code in PHP six years ago.</p>
            <p>One thing that eluded me for a while is the narrative around <i>Implied Volatility</i> â€“ a phenonemon that only presented itself after the black swan crash of 1987 where the markets went down double digit percentages.</p>
            <p>The effect appears to be created by options buyers in the market that are willing to pay more for options far out-of-the-money and far in-the-money, however the concept of flat volatility space is dependent on the concept that market returns are normally distributed â€“ which as of the crash in 1987 we know they are not.</p>
            <p>If we know markets are abnormal, and we can more closely model returns than with a normal distribution, we should in theory be able to model those returns to find the effective Black-Scholes values, and find an implied volatility curve for a given option.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>The what:</b> I created a better model for equity returns and applied it to create implied volatility curves for equities to find option mispricings on Robinhood.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>The result:</b> A much better guide for quickly selecting options strategies that gives me a market neutral advantage on options that are over/underpriced by the market.</p>

            <h3>Organic Font Display</h3>
            <p>Computers are excellent at perfection â€” they excel at doing exactly what they're told. With standard font support on computers, we've become constrained by the perfection of our computers&rsquo; typesetting ability. Before the NYC Subway signs were digitized and developed using Helvetica, they were made by hand with a mÃ©lange of fonts like <a href="https://klim.co.nz/blog/new-details-about-origins-akzidenz-grotesk/" target="_blank">Akzidenz Grotesk</a> and set with far less precision than any modern program. This demo has been created using a descendent of <i>Akzidenz Grotesk</i> to best resemble the feel of the 1970's NYC subway signs.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>The what:</b> I created a way to deconstruct fonts as their constituent SVG characters, where I re-set them using any built in kerning information (or not!) and a collection of important esoterics like <i>horiz-adv-x</i> and <i>cap-height</i>.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>The result:</b> A subtly more &ldquo;human&rdquo; font display. Similar to the result of an unskilled typographer setting letters on a poster. This can also be used to open the door to SVG-level animations â€“ but on text. <i>Inspect element</i> on the graphic demo to see how it's created.

            <h3>Bit Arrays in JS</h3>
            <p>While programming a markov chain backtesting strategy I was holding millions of booleans. This was in the 2010s, so while the optimization was not worth making as I wasn't running this on my grandpa's <i>Commodore 64</i>, I was curious about the speed tradeoff and memory savings you could save by converting an array of booleans to a bit-flag array.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>The what:</b> I created  a bit-flag array using 32-bit fixed arrays in javascript.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>The result:</b> A structure that was 98.7% smaller than an array of booleans, and 30% faster than a dynamically allocated array.</p>
